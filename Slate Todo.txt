-expand abbreviations

-open files as new file (unless on blank file)

Long Term:
-Tabs[done]

-headers
-comment code
-section header dropdown menu from button

Known Bugs:
-After alt-tabbing, ctrl n throws an error, but the app continue to function, also occurs after drag + drop (sometimes occurs with ctrl w I think)

-After scrolling down and switching to a doc that doesn't need to scroll, you are still able to scroll down

-String out of bounds exception when clicking "cancel" during save as [fixed]

-Cannot undo in an editspace where a file has been opened [fixed]


Scrapped Ideas:
-replace edges of apllication with small jpanels instead of JTextArea margins so that text avoids edges while scrolling [I've come to enjoy the look] 
-windows default look and feel in file chooser ONLY [This looks pretty bad, maybe find a better look and feel or create my own]
-Maybe rich text[I have no interest in rich text]
